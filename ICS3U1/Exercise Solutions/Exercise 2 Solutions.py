#Create 6 different 24-card game combinations.
#Rule 1: You can use only 4 numbers
#Rule 2: You can only choose numbers from 1-13
#Rule 3: For 1 out of the 6 combination, you need to use the ** operator
#Rule 4: For 1 out of the 6 combination, you need to use the % operator 
#Rule 5: For 1 out of the 6 combination, you need to use the // operator

#Here's an example
print("#0 : (8 + 8 + 8) * 1 =", (8 + 8 + 8) * 1)
print("#1 : 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = ", 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 )
#Rule 6: You need to type the games combination twice for each row. 
#First time between the double quotes -> """ 
#Second time, after the comma -> ,
#This is not allowed : print("#0 : (8 + 8 + 8) * 1 =", 24)

#Now do 6 more!
print("#2 : 4 ** 1 + 10 + 10 =", 4 ** 1 + 10 + 10)
print("#3 : 4 % 1 + 12 + 12 =", 4 % 1 + 12 + 12)
print("#4 : 10 // 1 + 6 + 6 =", 10 // 1 + 6 + 6)
print("#5 : 6 * 6 - 6 - 6 =", 6 * 6 - 6 - 6)
print("#6 : 4 * 4 + 4 + 4 =", 4 * 4 + 4 + 4)
print("#7 : 12 / 1 + 4 * 3 =", 12 / 1 + 4 * 3)
